          <h2>Safety Management Systems (SMS)</h2>
          <p>
            Aviation software often includes Safety Management Systems (SMS)
            that allow airlines, airports, and regulatory authorities to
            identify, assess, and mitigate safety risks. These systems track
            incidents, analyze data trends, and facilitate proactive safety
            measures to enhance overall aviation safety.

          <h2>Flight Operations Management</h2>
          <p>
            Software is used for flight planning, scheduling, and monitoring of
            aircraft. It incorporates weather data, airspace restrictions, and
            aircraft performance parameters to optimize routes, fuel
            consumption, and flight times while ensuring compliance with safety
            regulations.

          <h2>Air Traffic Management (ATM)</h2>
          <p>
            ATM software enhances airspace capacity, reduces congestion, and
            improves flight efficiency. It includes tools for air traffic
            controllers to manage aircraft trajectories, provide real-time
            updates to pilots, and minimize delays through automation and
            data-driven decision-making.

          <h2>Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO)</h2>
          <p>
            Aviation software streamlines maintenance operations by scheduling
            inspections, tracking component health, and managing inventory.
            Predictive maintenance algorithms analyze data from sensors and
            historical records to identify potential failures before they occur,
            minimizing downtime and improving safety.
